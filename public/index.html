            starting to look for roles in Tech industry. As a computer 
            science major, I'm fascinated by the technology that shape 
            our world. How can computer improve communication among 
            diversed people? How is computer able to perform tasks that 
            initially require human intervention?

            As such, I've engaged in lots of computer science courseworks, 
            online courses and personal projects. And now I'd like to put 
            that experience to good use, solving real-world problems."
